 * when the PresenterContext is told to show an xml file. Its dependencies are then instantiated and injected.
 *
 * If a View is specified as the fx:controller of an FXML file, then the View is instantiated first, and then
 * the Presenter, which is injected into the view. The PresenterContext then injects a reference to the View
 * into the Presenter as well.
