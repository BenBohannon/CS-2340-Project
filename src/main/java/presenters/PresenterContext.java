/**
 * Created by brian on 9/16/15.
 * Singleton object that is injected into each presenter to allow facilitate
 * simple functions such as Scene swapping while using the same dependency
 * injector.
 * The PresenterContext should receive as constructor params the dependency injector
 * bindings and Stage from the entry point, which should make for easier testing. A
 * test entry point could simply supply a different module to change the behavior
 * of the program. An instance of PresenterContext additionally binds itself to be
 * injected as a singleton into each {@link Presenter} it generates. This is so that
 * the same dependency injector configuration can be used for every new Presenter
 * generated for an fxml view.
