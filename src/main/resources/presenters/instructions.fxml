After landing on the planet and dropping off Irata's one and only 'Colony Store / MULE Outfitter / Pub &amp; Casino', you're ready to begin. Irata is comprised of 3 different types of terrain. Each resource is ideally suited to only one type. River = food bonus, Plain = energy bonus, Mountain (the bigger the better) = Smithore bonus.&#10;&#10;Plot Selection:&#10;When the turn begins, each plot of land will be highlighted, starting with the top left corner and moving from left to right, row by row. When the plot you are interested in is highlighted, quickly select it.&#10;&#10;Land Development:&#10;To harvest and collect the planetâ€™s resources, you and the other players must purchase MULEs from the Store, and install them on plots of land before the time runs out!&#10;&#10;Auction:&#10;The auction phase is where you and the other players directly impact Irata's economy. Buy low, sell high is the name of the game but much more can happen with bidding wars, withholding needed resources from the other players, buying out the store to create a monopoly, etc.&#10;&#10;Controls:&#10;Player 1 - A to select land&#10;                 Q/Z to control auction&#10;Player 2 - S to select land&#10;                 W/X to control auction&#10;Player 3 - D to select land&#10;                 E/C to control auction&#10;Player 4 - F to select land&#10;                 R/V to control auction&#10;&#10;&#10;Good Luck Colonists!" wrapText="true" />
